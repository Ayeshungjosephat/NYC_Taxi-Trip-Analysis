# NYC_Taxi-Trip-Analysis
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Taxi Trip Analysis project aims to extract insights from taxi trip data, including trip duration, fare trends, demand patterns, and driver efficiency. The objective is to optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction.

### Objectives
- Analyze taxi trip trends over two years
- Identify peak travel times and busiest days
- Determine the most popular boroughs for pickups/drop-offs
- Evaluate revenue distribution and payment methods
- Provide actionable insights for optimizing taxi services

### Dataset Used
- Source: NYC Taxi Trip Data
Data Fields:
- Trip Details: Pickup time, drop-off time, distance
- Fare Information: Total fare, tip amount, payment type
- Trip Metadata: Boroughs, timestamps, fiscal week

### Tools & Technologies
- Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation
- Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning
- SQL – Data extraction and processing
- Excel – Data organization and additional analysis

### Key Metrics & Insights
1. Total Trips & Revenue
- 6M total trips analyzed
- $89.5M in total revenue
- $15.4 average fare per trip

2. Time-Based Analysis
- Peak travel times: 6 AM - 9 AM & 3 PM - 6 PM
- Busiest day: Sunday, with 0.96M trips
- Monthly trends: February had the highest trips (0.81M)

3. Borough Distribution
- Top locations: Manhattan (40.14%) & Brooklyn (26.08%)
- Least trips: Staten Island (0.05%)

4. Payment Methods
- Credit Card (3.3M trips) is the preferred method
- Cash payments accounted for 2.6M trips

### Visualizations
- Bar Charts: Trip volume by time, day, and month
- Pie Charts: Borough-wise trip distribution
- Stacked Area Charts: Trip patterns over time
- KPIs: Total revenue, average fare, trip count

### Business Impact
- Helped identify peak demand hours for better fleet allocation
- Enabled pricing adjustments based on trip trends
- Assisted in decision-making for payment method preferences

### Limitation
Few trips were recorded after late 2019 dew  to the Covid-19 pandemic which impacted movement. This created a bias in the analysis since more data were gotten in 2019.

### Conclusion & Future Improvements
- Expand analysis to include weather and traffic impact
- Implement predictive analytics for fare forecasting
- Enhance visualization with real-time trip tracking
- Use a more robust data set to remove any form of bias.
